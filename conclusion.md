# âœ“ Conclusion

This research provided a detailed evaluation of CausVid, a video generation model [hypothesized to be a distilled/optimized version of Wan 2.1], with a specific focus on its performance on the NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 GPU. We conducted a comparative analysis against [mention compared models if any, or state it was a focused benchmark].

**Key Findings:**
* CausVid demonstrated notable efficiency on the NVIDIA H100, with a peak VRAM usage of 21.56GB.
* It achieved a prompt-to-output generation time of 43 seconds per video (832x480, 81 frames, 6 steps, 1 CFG), with a core sampling time of 21 seconds. In scenarios allowing for continuous generation, an effective rate of approximately 22 seconds per video was observed.

* Qualitatively, CausVid [briefly summarize its visual output characteristics based on your results].

**Contributions:**
This study offers valuable, concrete performance benchmarks for CausVid on modern, high-performance GPU hardware. These metrics provide a baseline for developers and researchers looking to leverage fast video generation capabilities. The [comparative analysis, if performed] further contextualizes CausVid's strengths and weaknesses within the current landscape of AI video synthesis.

**Implications:**
The efficiency demonstrated by CausVid, particularly its rapid generation at a moderate VRAM footprint on the H100, suggests its potential for applications requiring quick turnaround times, interactive video generation, or deployment in environments where computational resources, while powerful, still need to be managed efficiently. As AI video generation continues to evolve, models like CausVid that prioritize speed and efficiency will play a crucial role in broadening accessibility and enabling new use cases.

Future research should continue to explore the trade-offs between speed, quality, and resource consumption in video generation, investigate further optimization techniques, and expand benchmarks across diverse hardware and larger sets of models.
