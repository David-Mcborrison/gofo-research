# Abstract

**Context:** Advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly pushed the boundaries of video generation, leading to models capable of producing increasingly realistic and coherent dynamic scenes. However, challenges related to computational efficiency, generation speed, and resource consumption persist.

**Purpose:** This research presents a comparative analysis focusing on **CausVid** (a distilled version of Wan 2.1 aimed at faster video generation). We evaluate its performance, particularly in terms of speed and resource utilization, against [mention other models/techniques you are comparing against, e.g., the original Wan 2.1, other prominent video diffusion models].

**Methodology:** The study involves benchmarking video generation tasks on an **NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 GPU**. Key parameters for CausVid tests included 6 steps, a CFG scale of 1, generating 81 frames at 832x480 resolution. We measured peak VRAM usage, sampling time, and overall generation time. Qualitative aspects [mention how, e.g., visual fidelity, temporal coherence] were also assessed.

**Key Findings (CausVid on H100):**
* **Peak VRAM Usage:** 21.56GB
* **Generation Time (Prompt to Output):** 43 seconds per video
* **Sampling Time:** 21 seconds per video (at 3.65 iterations/second)
* **Overall Throughput Example:** A process completing in 37 seconds start-to-finish, with individual videos within that process taking approximately 22 seconds.
* [Add a brief note on comparative findings here once you have them.]

**Implications:** The findings highlight CausVid's potential for rapid video prototyping and generation in resource-aware scenarios. This study provides valuable benchmarks for researchers and practitioners working with state-of-the-art video generation models.
