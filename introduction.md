# üìù Introduction

## Background
The field of AI-driven video generation has witnessed remarkable progress... [Expand on the current state of video synthesis, its applications, and general advancements.]

The demand for high-quality, efficiently generated video content is increasing across various domains, from entertainment and media to simulation and education. However, many state-of-the-art models require substantial computational resources and time...

## Problem Statement
This paper addresses the need for efficient video generation by evaluating **CausVid**, a distilled variant of the Wan 2.1 model. The primary research question is: *How does CausVid compare to [mention baseline model, e.g., Wan 2.1, and/or other contemporary models] in terms of generation speed, resource consumption (VRAM), and output quality when benchmarked under specific hardware conditions?*

## Our Contribution
This work provides:
1.  Detailed performance benchmarks of CausVid on the cutting-edge NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 GPU, offering insights into its operational characteristics (e.g., 21.56GB peak VRAM, 43s prompt-to-output per video, 21s sampling time).
2.  A comparative analysis of CausVid against [mention models] focusing on [mention key comparison aspects: speed, quality, resource use].
3.  [Any other unique contributions of your study].
