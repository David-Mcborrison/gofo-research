# ðŸ’¬ Discussion

This section interprets the results presented in the previous section, discusses their implications in the context of existing research, acknowledges the limitations of this study, and suggests avenues for future work.

## Interpretation of Findings

* **CausVid's Performance Profile:**
    * Discuss the significance of the 21.56GB VRAM usage on an H100. Is this low, moderate, or high for its capability and compared to peers?
    * Analyze the speed metrics (43s prompt-to-output, 21s sampling, ~22s batched). How does this position CausVid for different applications (e.g., rapid prototyping vs. high-fidelity production)?
    * The 6-step generation is very fast. How does this affect quality compared to models typically run with more steps? Relate this to your qualitative findings.
* **Comparative Analysis:**
    * What are the key trade-offs observed between CausVid and [Model 2], [Model 3], etc.? (e.g., "CausVid offers significantly faster generation than Model X, but Model X achieves higher temporal coherence...")
    * Does CausVid successfully achieve its goal as a distilled/optimized model compared to its parent (e.g., Wan 2.1 if applicable)?
* **Impact of NVIDIA H100:**
    * Briefly discuss how the H100's capabilities (e.g., HBM3 memory bandwidth, Hopper architecture) might contribute to the observed performance. Are these results specific to such high-end hardware, or do they suggest broader efficiency gains?

## Comparison with Related Work
* How do your findings for CausVid (and other models tested) compare with published results for other video generation models?
* Does your study confirm or contradict previous findings on model distillation for generative tasks?
* Does the performance on the H100 align with expectations or provide new insights into scaling these models?

## Limitations of the Study
* **Scope of Models:** The comparison was limited to [CausVid, Model 2, ...]. Other important models may not have been included.
* **Prompt Diversity:** The set of prompts used might not cover all possible scenarios or complexities.
* **Parameter Settings:** While parameters for CausVid were fixed, choices for other models might influence outcomes. Justify your choices.
* **Qualitative Evaluation Subjectivity:** If human evaluation was used, mention potential biases or limited evaluator pool. If only author assessment, state that.
* **Hardware Specificity:** Results are specific to the NVIDIA H100. Performance may vary on different hardware.
* **Definition of "it/s":** [If the 3.65 it/s metric required assumptions or wasn't perfectly standard, reiterate that here.]

## Future Work
* **Broader Model Comparison:** Extend the comparison to include more state-of-the-art video generation models.
* **In-depth Qualitative Analysis:** Conduct formal user studies to evaluate video quality and prompt adherence more rigorously.
* **Parameter Sweeps:** Investigate the impact of varying parameters (e.g., steps, CFG scale) on CausVid's performance and quality.
* **Diverse Hardware Benchmarking:** Test CausVid on a wider range of GPUs to assess its performance scalability.
* **Application-Specific Testing:** Evaluate CausVid in the context of specific downstream applications (e.g., content creation, simulation).
* **Further Optimization:** Explore if CausVid can be further optimized (e.g., through quantization, improved samplers).
