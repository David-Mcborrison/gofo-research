This section presents the findings from our comparative experiments, focusing on the performance and output characteristics of CausVid and the other models evaluated.

## Performance Benchmarks

### CausVid on NVIDIA H100
The performance of CausVid was specifically benchmarked on an NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 GPU with the following parameters: 6 Steps, 1 CFG, 832x480 resolution, 81 frames.

* **Peak VRAM Usage:** **21.56 GB**
* **Generation Time (Prompt to Output):** **43 seconds per video**
    * This metric represents the total wall-clock time for generating a single video from prompt submission to file output in an isolated run.
* **Sampling Time:** **21 seconds per video**
    * This is the core time spent in the iterative generation (denoising/sampling) loop.
* **Sampling Speed:** **3.65 it/s**
    * [Provide clarification here based on your definition of "iteration" as noted in Methodology. E.g., "This corresponds to X frames per second processed during the sampling phase" or "Y sampling steps completed per second."]
* **Overall Throughput (Start-to-Finish):**
    * A representative generation process completed in **37 seconds start to finish.**
    * In continuous or batched generation scenarios, the effective time per video was approximately **22 seconds.**
    * [Elaborate on the context of these two figures, e.g., "The 37-second figure includes initial setup/model loading for a session, while the 22-second figure reflects the amortized time per video when generating multiple videos consecutively."]
